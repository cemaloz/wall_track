# wall_track

Add the package to your workspace. Then run the following commands in 2 different terminals:
In first terminal, command  launch file that contain robot and wall to track
In second terminal run the algorithm launch file


Wall tracking using bug2 algorithm with hamer robot.
HAMER is a robotic project that is being developed for robotic education.
For HAMER:https://github.com/Akerdogmus/hamer

In bug2 algorithm, The robot always tries to move towards the target along the line of sight with the support of the line that calculates the basic Euclidean distance function. If an obstacle is encountered, a canonical direction is followed until the line of sight is encountered.The robot always tries to move towards the target along the line of sight with the support of the line that calculates the basic Euclidean distance function.
